# Highradius

## Description

This project involves the creation of data models, machine learning models, UI components, and back-end design. The primary objective is to integrate various technologies to build a cohesive and functional application.

## Technology Stack

- **Machine Learning**: Implemented using Python
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Back-end**: Java with JDBC and Flask
- **Front-end**: ReactJS and Material-UI

## Features

- **Data Models**: Created appropriate data models to effectively structure and organize the data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Developed machine learning models to analyze and predict data.
- **UI Components**: Designed and implemented user-friendly UI components using ReactJS and Material-UI.
- **Back-end Design**: Developed a robust back-end using Java with JDBC and Flask to handle data processing and API interactions.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- MySQL
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Node.js and npm

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harsh20042002/Highradiusproject.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Set Up the Back-end**:

   - **Java with JDBC**:
     - Ensure you have JDK installed.
     - Set up your MySQL database and update the JDBC connection details in the Java files.
     - Compile and run the Java application.

   - **Flask**:
     - Install Flask and other required Python packages:
       ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```
     - Run the Flask server:
       ```bash
       flask run
       ```

3. **Set Up the Front-end**:

   - Navigate to the front-end directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install the required npm packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the ReactJS application:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Back-end**:
   - Start the Java application and ensure it connects to your MySQL database.
   - Run the Flask server to handle API requests.

2. **Run the Front-end**:
   - Start the ReactJS application and open it in your browser.

3. **Interact with the Application**:
   - Use the UI components to input data and interact with the machine learning models.
   - View predictions and other results generated by the machine learning models.
